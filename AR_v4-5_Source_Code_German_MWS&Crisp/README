Unfortunately we did not have these sources available when we started working on the
CyberpunX Replay but got ahold of them about a year after the first working and assembleable
resource was done.

MWS and Crisp resourced a v4 version and added quite a few comments but moving the assembled
output within the ROM will likely fail (due to the resource not being "complete" at some places).
Their resourced and translated to german version was sold in germany as some v5 professional ROM and
allowed us to take over some comments from their source.

The source code is in Turbo Assembler format and assembles OK but requires the correct code of the
IO areas from the cart it was resourced from since they were not included when obtaining these sources.

Trying to add the right roms here soonish, but not currently having a suitable IO ROM piece also means
that the collection is not yet complete :(
